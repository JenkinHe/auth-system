confirm i have the best vscode setup(intellisense e.g. show suggestion when accessing methods for a class)
need logs for debugging
make dependency injection work
make the colours for my vscode look nice
bloated configs and bloated modules from trial and error
migrate from routing-controllersd to a more supported routing system
ask if theres anything i can add on to make it more robust, better, more modern etc
